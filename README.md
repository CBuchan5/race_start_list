# race_start_list

Before an event occurs, an event organiser needs to have a list of all the participants who are taking part in their event and which race they are running in . This list is called a ‘race startlist’.

When someone makes a booking through our site, we need to collect all their relevant information and display it to our event organisers in a clear, easy to read format.
